# 🛒 GROCEREASE – Grocery Store Management System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
**GROCEREASE** is a database-driven Grocery Store Management System developed using **MySQL**.  
The project is designed to simulate real-world grocery store operations by managing and analyzing data related to products, customers, suppliers, employees, and orders.

This system focuses on **relational database design**, **data integrity**, and **analytical SQL queries** to support business decision-making in a retail environment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a structured and normalized grocery store database
- Maintain relationships between customers, products, suppliers, employees, and orders
- Analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance
- Demonstrate practical use of SQL joins, aggregations, and constraints

## 🗂️ Database Structure
The database consists of the following interconnected tables:

- **Suppliers** – Supplier details and sourcing information  
- **Categories** – Product classification (grains, dairy, snacks, etc.)
- **Products** – Product pricing, stock, and category mapping
- **Customers** – Customer demographic information
- **Store_Employees** – Employee details handling store operations
- **Orders** – Customer order records
- **OrderDetails** – Item-wise order breakdown (quantity, price)

All tables are linked using **primary and foreign keys** to ensure data consistency.
